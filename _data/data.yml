    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I always believe that **AI will change our lives more comfortable than now.**
      Hence, I have enough passion to do my work such as develop AI servies, experiment for making SOTA model, etc. 
      
      I'm working at Naver for solving difficult problems using machine learning. 
      Currently, my research interest is **Active Learning**. Briefly speaking, each of the data has a different
      impact to model while training. In other words, only some data which has huge impact to model is enough to train the model, 
      and we can save the labeling cost. I expect that it can solve many kinds of machine learning problems such as 
      **Semi-supervised Learning**, **Class Incremental Learning**, etc.

experiences:
    - role: AI Research Engineer
      time: 2019 - Present
      company: Naver, Seongnam
      details: |
        Naver corp. expects me two roles; developing automatic pipeline, and doing research on new method. 
        During developing the automatic pipeline, I experienced **Dockerizing**, and **Airflow**. 
        For research perspective, I mainly use the pytorch but can use the tensorlfow either. 
        Moreover, there are lots of chances to use real service data in Naver so that I establish and use 
        the non-SQL DB, which is mongoDB for handling big data. Here are the summaries that I worked in Naver.

        - Active Learning and Semi-Supervised Learning in AI Assistant Audio Data
